This is a quick Python script I wrote to get all the Kxxx and Wxxx US radio and TV station call signs, and list which
were in use (found_call_letters.txt) and not in use (not_found_call_letters.txt). Of course, this script is very much
"wingin' it", so results aren't guaranteed, and you should do your diligence before relying on anything
you get from this.


Delete the two .txt files and run call_letters.py to pull them again fresh, or use the pre-compiled lists that were
generated... whenever Git says they were generated.
